Background:

We are trying build an API that answers questions about a network of people.

 

There are two data sets attached to the email. First file contains list of 100 people and their names. Second file has the relationship of each person with at least 5 other folks on the list.

 

Requirements:

Create an API Server with the following functionality
Get a user by id
Get the connections from user id=X
How many total connections  does user id=X has?
Who can introduce user id=X to user id=Y?
Which connections are common between user id=X and user id=Y?
Which user has the most connections?
Which user has the least connections?
The APIs should accept “degree” as a parameter
1st-degree connections - People you're directly connected.
2nd-degree connections - People who are connected to your 1st-degree connections.
3rd-degree connections - People who are connected to your 2nd-degree connections
Nth-degree connections – People who are connected to your (n-1)th-degree connections
 

You are free to use any language and technology in your solution.

 

Let me know if you have any questions.
